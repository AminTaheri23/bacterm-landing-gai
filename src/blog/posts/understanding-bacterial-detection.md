## Our Approach

BactermFinder leverages the unique relationship between terminators and their associated bacteria to create a highly sensitive detection system.

### Key Benefits

2. **High Accuracy**: Reduced false positives compared to traditional methods

## How It Works

Our system samples for specific bacterial markers that are strongly associated with terminator colonies. These biomarkers serve as early warning signs, allowing for timely intervention.

## Results

Initial testing has shown [promising results with high detection rates](https://example.com/paper), positioning BactermFinder as a leading solution in terminator detection technology.
